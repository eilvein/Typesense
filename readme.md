#  Typesense Theme for WP

## July 18h, 2013 update

Initial commit of the theme. 

## What is it?

Typesense is a (very) simple and fluid layout for Wordpress. I used the *HTML5 Reset Theme* to build it (see below). 

#### Typesense is extremely light and minimal

This theme doesn't include any social feature such as comments or twitter/facebook share buttons. I genuinely think that those options make people look desperate (unless you are a blog super-star, in which case you probably already have a theme!). +, the Facebook and twitter API are usually pretty slow so, that'd be silly to slow your page down just because of ugly, unessential buttons right? 

If you want to activate the comment feature, just remove the relevant comment syntax in single.php. You'll have to make it pretty by yourself though! (luckily, thanks to the HTML 5 Reset team, all the classes are already in the stylesheet document). 

#### Typesense uses Georgia and Helvetica Neue 

This theme extensively uses the Georgia typeface. This typeface has proven to be one of the most readable (and beautiful, imho) serif typeface included from start in all decent modern computers (Mac, PC, Linux). 

#### Typesense is easily cusomizable 

DYIers can tweak that theme pretty easily. If you want to use another language than english, .po files are naturally included.

#### Typesense is my first theme

So please be forgiving :)
I've just started developping my own stuff so I wouldn't expect any magic to happen when installing this theme. It's pretty rough. 

## HTML 5 Reset Wordpress Theme

The HTML5 Reset WordPress theme is a blank theme based on the [HTML5 Reset templates](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset). It's a great empty slate upon which to build your own HTML5-based WordPress themes.
